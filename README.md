## Overview
 Beer Here is a React application designed to help users discover breweries in Phoenix, Atlanta, and Denver. The app features a BrewContainer component that maps over a list of breweries, displaying each one with details such as name, type, and city in BrewCard components.

## Preview


## Context
This is my final solo project for the end of Mod 3. This project showcases my understanding and use of React.js library, React-router, GET and  POST request, passing props and acontrolled form. I incorporate these concepts in my application by using an api to fetch data, display and making it manipulatable through filtering and searhing. I add the use of router to route to the specific clicked brewery detail page updating the url with the correct brewery_id.
